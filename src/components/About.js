                Who am I?  Well, I can tell you I am not 24601, nor am I Jean Val
                Jean, I’m Howard Kier. But who is Howard?  Simple words such as
                intelligent, experienced, leader, problem solver, creative, and
                hard-working are cliché and simply not enough to convey the full
                depth of my skills, experiences, passions and other intangibles
                which make me who I am.

            <p>Writing about ones’ self is not easy.  But let me start with
                my high school motto, words which have stuck with me over the
                years, “Knowledge is Power.”  More than anything, I enjoy
                learning new information and skills.  Over the years, I’ve
                continued to learn new skills and stay abreast of the latest
                computer technologies while retaining the lessons of the past.

                No matter where life has taken me, from corporate programmer,
                to small business owner and even as a substitute teacher, my goal
                has been to make the world a better place and sharing knowledge to
                help others, improve products/processes and solve problems.
